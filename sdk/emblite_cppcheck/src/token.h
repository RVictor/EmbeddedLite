/**
 * @brief The token list that the Tokenizer generates is a linked-list of this class.
 *
 * Tokens are stored as strings. The "if", "while", etc are stored in plain text.
 * The reason the Token class is needed (instead of using the string class) is that some extra functionality is also needed for tokens:
 *  - location of the token is stored (linenr, fileIndex)
 *  - functions for classifying the token (isName, isNumber, isBoolean, isStandardType)
 *
 * The Token class also has other functions for management of token list, matching tokens, etc.
